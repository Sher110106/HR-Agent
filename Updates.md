Here are the 10 most practical, high-leverage changes that will measurably improve speed, memory use, reliability and security.  
For every change you get ❶ WHAT to alter, ❷ HOW to implement it, and ❸ WHY it directly or indirectly boosts performance.

- 1  Replace the pandas “sheet-dict” with an in-memory DuckDB database  
  - How:  
    - At file upload, open `con = duckdb.connect(":memory:")`.  
    - Stream each sheet via `pd.read_excel(..., chunksize=50_000)` and write straight into DuckDB:  
      ```python
      for chunk in pd.read_excel(fp, sheet_name=s, chunksize=50_000):
          con.execute(f"CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE {tbl} AS SELECT * FROM chunk") 
      ```  
  - Why: column-vector execution, automatic spill-to-disk and SIMD give 2-30× faster GROUP BY / JOINs and let you analyse files far beyond RAM limits.

- 2  Swap LLM-generated Python for LLM-generated SQL  
  - How: turn `ExcelCodeGenerationAgent` into `SQLGenerationAgent`; prompt it with the DuckDB schema and require a single SELECT statement.  
  - Why: eliminates the cost and risk of executing arbitrary Python, lets DuckDB’s optimiser pick the fastest plan, and shortens the code that must be transferred over the network.

- 3  Add an `EXPLAIN` pre-flight validator before any SQL runs  
  - How:  
    ```python
    try:
        con.execute(f"EXPLAIN {sql}")
    except duckdb.ParserException:
        ask_llm_to_retry(sql, error_msg)
    ```  
  - Why: catching syntax/semantic errors early prevents costly full-query executions and avoids repeated LLM round-trips after a failure.

- 4  Push heavy joins and aggregations into DuckDB, keep plotting in a thin, sandboxed Python layer  
  - How: generate two artefacts:  
    1. `final_sql` – returns a tidy result table.  
    2. Minimal Python that receives a pandas `df` from `final_sql` and plots. Disallow imports other than `matplotlib`/`seaborn`.  
  - Why: 95 % of compute stays in the database engine; the Python sandbox now holds only kilobytes instead of gigabytes, slashing memory-pressure and cold-start time.

 
- 9  Instrument every agent with OpenTelemetry tracing  
  - How: wrap major calls (`read_excel`, `sql_generate`, `execute_sql`, `plot`) in `@tracer.start_as_current_span(...)` and export to Jaeger/Prometheus.  
  - Why: lets you spot the exact hotspot (e.g., 80 % of time in a single JOIN) and verify that each optimisation actually shortened the critical path.
