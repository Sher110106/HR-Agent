1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS:
- The analysis returned a single numerical result: 0.31885730472048973.
- This value represents the calculated attrition rate for the specified period, using the provided formula:
  - Numerator: (Number of Full-Time Employees Left) + (Number of Fixed-Term Employees who left before contract expiry)
  - Denominator: Average number of Full-Time Employees + Fixed-Term Employees during the period.
- The attrition rate is approximately 31.89%.
2. BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- An attrition rate of 31.89% is significantly high by most industry standards (typical healthy annual attrition rates are often between 10% and 15%, though this varies by industry and region).
- High attrition can indicate issues with employee satisfaction, engagement, compensation, management, or work environment.
- It also implies increased costs for recruitment, onboarding, training, and potential loss of institutional knowledge.
3. KEY INSIGHTS:
- The organization is losing nearly 1 in 3 employees (full-time and fixed-term) within the measured period.
- This high turnover could be voluntary (e.g., career growth, compensation, work-life balance) or involuntary (e.g., performance, disciplinary issues).
- The rate suggests either systemic issues or a period of significant organizational change (e.g., restructuring, layoffs, or market challenges).
4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Immediately investigate the primary drivers of attrition by segmenting the data by reason (voluntary vs. involuntary, and specific categories).
- Conduct exit interviews and employee engagement surveys to identify root causes.
- Benchmark against industry peers to determine if this rate is unusually high for your sector.
- Review and enhance retention strategies: career development programs, compensation and benefits, management training, and work-life balance initiatives.
- Prioritize retention of high performers and critical roles to minimize business disruption.
5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- What is the breakdown of attrition by voluntary vs. involuntary reasons?
- Which departments, roles, or tenure groups are experiencing the highest attrition?
- How does this attrition rate compare to previous periods (trend analysis)?
- What is the impact of this attrition on business performance, customer satisfaction, and project delivery?
- Are there specific patterns by location, manager, or demographic group?
Based on your analysis, the calculated attrition rate is **31.89%** for the specified period. This means that nearly one-third of your full-time and fixed-term workforce left during this timeframeâ€”a level that is generally considered high and potentially concerning for most organizations.
**Business Implications:**
- Such a high attrition rate can disrupt operations, increase costs (recruitment, onboarding, lost productivity), and negatively impact morale and customer service.
- It may signal underlying issues such as dissatisfaction with compensation, limited career growth, poor management practices, or cultural misalignment.
**Key Insights:**
- The result highlights an urgent need to understand why employees are leaving at this rate.
- Without intervention, continued high attrition could erode organizational knowledge, weaken your employer brand, and hinder business growth.
**Actionable Recommendations:**
1. **Deep Dive Analysis:** Break down attrition by voluntary/involuntary reasons and by department, tenure, and role to pinpoint hotspots.
2. **Engagement & Exit Surveys:** Implement or enhance surveys to capture real reasons for departure and current employee sentiment.
3. **Retention Strategy:** Develop targeted retention initiativesâ€”such as career development, competitive compensation, flexible work arrangements, and management training.
4. **Benchmarking:** Compare your attrition rate to industry peers to contextualize the severity and set realistic improvement targets.
5. **Leadership Accountability:** Make retention a key performance indicator for managers, especially in high-turnover areas.
**Follow-Up Analyses:**
- What are the top three reasons for voluntary attrition?
- Which teams or locations have the highest turnover?
- How does this periodâ€™s attrition compare to the previous year?
- What is the cost of attrition to the business in terms of lost productivity and recruitment expenses?
**Summary:**  
A 31.89% attrition rate is a clear signal that immediate and strategic action is needed. Start by identifying the root causes, prioritize interventions for the most affected groups, and monitor progress closely to reduce turnover and improve organizational stability.
