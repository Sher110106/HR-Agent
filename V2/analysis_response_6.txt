1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS:
- The analysis focused on employees who left due to "Higher Studies" (either as a primary or secondary reason for attrition).
- Out of all such cases (n_higher_studies_attrition = 15), the most vulnerable age category is '36-40', with 3 employees in this group leaving for higher studies.
- The age distribution among these 15 cases is: '36-40': 3, '50+': 2, '26-30': 2, '20-25': 2, '41-45': 2, '46-50': 2, '31-35': 2. This shows a relatively even spread, but '36-40' stands out as the single largest group.
- Top locations where these attritions occurred: Mohali (5 cases), Bangalore (3), Mumbai (3).
- Top hometowns of these employees: Noida (4), Delhi (3), Ahmedabad (2).
2. BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- Losing employees to higher studies is a form of voluntary attrition, often linked to career aspirations and perceived lack of growth opportunities.
- The fact that the most vulnerable age group is '36-40' is notable, as this is typically considered a mid-career stage, where employees are expected to be consolidating their professional expertise rather than returning to education.
- The geographic concentration (Mohali, Bangalore, Mumbai) and hometown clustering (Noida, Delhi, Ahmedabad) could indicate regional factors influencing this trendâ€”such as proximity to educational institutions, local culture, or economic conditions.
3. KEY INSIGHTS:
- The '36-40' age group is the most at risk for leaving due to higher studies, with 3 out of 15 cases (20%).
- Attrition for higher studies is not limited to early-career employees; it affects mid-career and even senior employees ('50+' has 2 cases).
- Mohali is a significant hotspot, accounting for 5 out of 15 cases (33%), followed by Bangalore and Mumbai (3 each).
- Hometowns like Noida and Delhi are also overrepresented, suggesting possible links to personal networks or regional educational aspirations.
4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Investigate the specific motivations of '36-40' age group employeesâ€”are they seeking advanced degrees for career progression, or is there a perceived lack of internal growth opportunities?
- For locations like Mohali, Bangalore, and Mumbai, consider targeted retention strategiesâ€”such as partnerships with local universities for executive education, tuition reimbursement, or flexible work/study arrangements.
- Engage with employees from Noida, Delhi, and Ahmedabad to understand if there are unique cultural or economic drivers prompting higher studies attrition.
- Review career development and upskilling programs to ensure they meet the aspirations of mid-career employees, especially in high-risk locations.
5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- What are the roles or departments most affected by higher studies attrition in these locations?
- Is there a correlation between tenure or performance ratings and likelihood of leaving for higher studies?
- Are there seasonal or cyclical patterns (e.g., aligned with academic calendars) in higher studies attrition?
- How does compensation or promotion velocity compare for those who left for higher studies versus those who stayed?
- What is the rehire rate or boomerang potential for employees who left for higher studies?
Based on the analysis, here is a comprehensive breakdown and actionable guidance:
**1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS**
- Out of 15 employees who left for "Higher Studies," the most vulnerable age category is **36-40 years old** (3 employees).
- The age breakdown is:  
  - 36-40: 3  
  - 50+: 2  
  - 26-30: 2  
  - 20-25: 2  
  - 41-45: 2  
  - 46-50: 2  
  - 31-35: 2  
- The top locations where these attritions occurred are:  
  - Mohali: 5  
  - Bangalore: 3  
  - Mumbai: 3  
- The most common hometowns among these employees are:  
  - Noida: 4  
  - Delhi: 3  
  - Ahmedabad: 2  
**2. BUSINESS CONTEXT**
- Contrary to typical expectations, **mid-career professionals (36-40)** are the most likely to leave for higher studies, not just early-career staff.
- This trend may indicate unmet career development needs, a desire for career change, or a lack of advanced learning opportunities within the organization.
- The concentration in certain locations (Mohali, Bangalore, Mumbai) and hometowns (Noida, Delhi, Ahmedabad) suggests possible regional influencesâ€”such as access to universities, local culture valuing advanced degrees, or economic factors.
**3. KEY INSIGHTS**
- **Mid-career attrition risk:** Employees in the 36-40 age group are at the highest risk for leaving to pursue higher studies, representing 20% of such cases.
- **Geographic clustering:** Mohali is a particular hotspot, with one-third of all higher studies attrition cases.
- **Broad age impact:** The risk is spread across age groups, including senior employees (2 cases aged 50+), indicating this is not just an early-career phenomenon.
- **Regional/cultural factors:** The overrepresentation of Noida and Delhi as hometowns may point to cultural or network-driven motivations.
**4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **Targeted retention for mid-career employees:**  
  - Launch advanced learning, leadership, or executive education programs tailored to the 36-40 age group.
  - Offer tuition support, sabbaticals, or flexible work/study arrangementsâ€”especially in Mohali, Bangalore, and Mumbai.
- **Regional engagement:**  
  - Conduct focus groups or surveys in Mohali, Bangalore, Mumbai, Noida, and Delhi to understand local drivers.
  - Partner with local universities to offer in-house or joint certification programs.
- **Career development review:**  
  - Audit internal promotion and upskilling pathways to ensure they meet the aspirations of employees considering higher studies.
  - Highlight success stories of employees who advanced internally without leaving for further education.
- **Exit interview enhancement:**  
  - Deepen exit interviews for higher studies attrition cases to capture nuanced motivations and potential for future rehire.
**5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS**
- Which job roles or departments are most affected by higher studies attrition in these locations?
- Is there a link between tenure, job satisfaction, or performance and the likelihood of leaving for higher studies?
- Are there seasonal spikes (e.g., around university admission periods)?
- How do compensation and promotion rates compare for those leaving for higher studies versus those who stay?
- What is the return rate of employees who left for higher studies (boomerang hires)?
**Summary:**  
The data reveals a surprising vulnerability among mid-career employees (36-40) to higher studies attrition, with a strong geographic concentration in Mohali and among employees from Noida and Delhi. This suggests a need for targeted retention and development strategies, especially in these locations and age groups, and further investigation into the underlying drivers of this trend.
