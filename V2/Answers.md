Calculate the attrition rate
ðŸ§  Reasoning

Based on your analysis, the calculated attrition rate is 31.89% for the specified period. This means that nearly one-third of your full-time and fixed-term workforce left during this timeframeâ€”a level that is generally considered high and potentially concerning for most organizations.

Business Implications:

    Such a high attrition rate can disrupt operations, increase costs (recruitment, onboarding, lost productivity), and negatively impact morale and customer service.
    It may signal underlying issues such as dissatisfaction with compensation, limited career growth, poor management practices, or cultural misalignment.

Key Insights:

    The result highlights an urgent need to understand why employees are leaving at this rate.
    Without intervention, continued high attrition could erode organizational knowledge, weaken your employer brand, and hinder business growth.

Actionable Recommendations:

    Deep Dive Analysis: Break down attrition by voluntary/involuntary reasons and by department, tenure, and role to pinpoint hotspots.
    Engagement & Exit Surveys: Implement or enhance surveys to capture real reasons for departure and current employee sentiment.
    Retention Strategy: Develop targeted retention initiativesâ€”such as career development, competitive compensation, flexible work arrangements, and management training.
    Benchmarking: Compare your attrition rate to industry peers to contextualize the severity and set realistic improvement targets.
    Leadership Accountability: Make retention a key performance indicator for managers, especially in high-turnover areas.

Follow-Up Analyses:

    What are the top three reasons for voluntary attrition?
    Which teams or locations have the highest turnover?
    How does this periodâ€™s attrition compare to the previous year?
    What is the cost of attrition to the business in terms of lost productivity and recruitment expenses?

Summary:
A 31.89% attrition rate is a clear signal that immediate and strategic action is needed. Start by identifying the root causes, prioritize interventions for the most affected groups, and monitor progress closely to reduce turnover and improve organizational stability.

Plot the distribution of employee tenure and how does it relate to performance ratings or attrition?
ðŸ§  Reasoning

Based on the analysis of the plot and underlying data, here are the comprehensive business insights and recommendations:

1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS

    The data shows that employees who have left ("Attrited") are distributed across the entire tenure spectrum, from as little as 0.1 years to over 4 years.
    High performance ratings (4.0) are present among both Active and Attrited employees. For example, an employee with 2.5 years tenure and a 4.0 rating has left, as has one with 0.1 years tenure and a 4.0 rating.
    Attrition is not limited to low performers; some high performers are also leaving.
    There are Active employees with low performance ratings (e.g., 2.4 years tenure, 1.0 rating), indicating that low performers are sometimes retained.
    Attrition occurs both very early (0.1 years) and after several years (e.g., 4.0 years), suggesting multiple drivers.

2. BUSINESS CONTEXT

    These findings are crucial for HR and business leaders: losing high-performing, mid-tenure employees can be costly and disruptive.
    Early attrition (within the first year) may indicate onboarding, role fit, or expectation issues.
    Retaining low-performing employees may hinder team productivity and morale.

3. KEY INSIGHTS

    Attrition is not isolated to any single tenure or performance group; it is spread across the spectrum.
    High-performing employees are at risk of leaving, not just low performers.
    Early exits (low tenure) are present, which could indicate onboarding or cultural fit challenges.
    Some low-performing employees remain with the company for extended periods.

4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

    Conduct Exit Interviews: Focus on high-performing, mid-tenure employees to understand their reasons for leaving.
    Strengthen Onboarding: Review and enhance onboarding and early engagement processes to reduce very early attrition.
    Performance Management: Evaluate why low-performing employees are being retained and whether performance management processes need reinforcement.
    Targeted Retention Programs: Develop retention strategies specifically for high performers at risk of leaving, such as career development opportunities, recognition, or tailored incentives.
    Regular Tenure-Performance Reviews: Monitor tenure and performance data regularly to identify at-risk groups before attrition occurs.

5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

    What are the most common reasons for attrition among high-performing, mid-tenure employees?
    How does the overall attrition rate compare between different performance rating groups?
    Are there specific departments or roles where high-performing employees are more likely to leave?
    What is the impact of manager quality or engagement scores on these attrition patterns?
    How do compensation and career progression opportunities correlate with attrition among different tenure and performance cohorts?

Summary:
The analysis reveals that attrition affects both high and low performers across all tenure ranges, with notable early exits and some retention of low performers. The business should prioritize understanding and addressing the drivers of high-performer attrition, strengthen onboarding, and review performance management practices to optimize retention and workforce quality. Further segmentation by department, role, and attrition reason will provide deeper, actionable insights.

Among employees who left due to "Higher Studies" (as Primary or Secondary Reason for Attrition), which Age Category is most vulnerable, and is there a geographic linkage (e.g., higher rates from certain Locations or Hometowns like Mumbai or Remote)?
ðŸ§  Reasoning

Based on the analysis, here is a comprehensive breakdown and actionable guidance:

1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS

    Out of 15 employees who left for "Higher Studies," the most vulnerable age category is 36-40 years old (3 employees).
    The age breakdown is:
        36-40: 3
        50+: 2
        26-30: 2
        20-25: 2
        41-45: 2
        46-50: 2
        31-35: 2
    The top locations where these attritions occurred are:
        Mohali: 5
        Bangalore: 3
        Mumbai: 3
    The most common hometowns among these employees are:
        Noida: 4
        Delhi: 3
        Ahmedabad: 2

2. BUSINESS CONTEXT

    Contrary to typical expectations, mid-career professionals (36-40) are the most likely to leave for higher studies, not just early-career staff.
    This trend may indicate unmet career development needs, a desire for career change, or a lack of advanced learning opportunities within the organization.
    The concentration in certain locations (Mohali, Bangalore, Mumbai) and hometowns (Noida, Delhi, Ahmedabad) suggests possible regional influencesâ€”such as access to universities, local culture valuing advanced degrees, or economic factors.

3. KEY INSIGHTS

    Mid-career attrition risk: Employees in the 36-40 age group are at the highest risk for leaving to pursue higher studies, representing 20% of such cases.
    Geographic clustering: Mohali is a particular hotspot, with one-third of all higher studies attrition cases.
    Broad age impact: The risk is spread across age groups, including senior employees (2 cases aged 50+), indicating this is not just an early-career phenomenon.
    Regional/cultural factors: The overrepresentation of Noida and Delhi as hometowns may point to cultural or network-driven motivations.

4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

    Targeted retention for mid-career employees:
        Launch advanced learning, leadership, or executive education programs tailored to the 36-40 age group.
        Offer tuition support, sabbaticals, or flexible work/study arrangementsâ€”especially in Mohali, Bangalore, and Mumbai.
    Regional engagement:
        Conduct focus groups or surveys in Mohali, Bangalore, Mumbai, Noida, and Delhi to understand local drivers.
        Partner with local universities to offer in-house or joint certification programs.
    Career development review:
        Audit internal promotion and upskilling pathways to ensure they meet the aspirations of employees considering higher studies.
        Highlight success stories of employees who advanced internally without leaving for further education.
    Exit interview enhancement:
        Deepen exit interviews for higher studies attrition cases to capture nuanced motivations and potential for future rehire.

5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

    Which job roles or departments are most affected by higher studies attrition in these locations?
    Is there a link between tenure, job satisfaction, or performance and the likelihood of leaving for higher studies?
    Are there seasonal spikes (e.g., around university admission periods)?
    How do compensation and promotion rates compare for those leaving for higher studies versus those who stay?
    What is the return rate of employees who left for higher studies (boomerang hires)?

Summary:
The data reveals a surprising vulnerability among mid-career employees (36-40) to higher studies attrition, with a strong geographic concentration in Mohali and among employees from Noida and Delhi. This suggests a need for targeted retention and development strategies, especially in these locations and age groups, and further investigation into the underlying drivers of this trend.

How does attrition rate (based on Inactive status and Types of Attrition) vary by Reporting Manager (or Reporting Manager Employee ID), and is there a correlation with team-level factors such as average team tenure (Time spent in Plaksha) or performance ratings within those manager groups?
ðŸ§  Reasoning

Based on the analysis of the provided results:

1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS:

    For both Ethan Koshy (Manager_ID: PU20231320) and Janya Oza (Manager_ID: PU20231332), the attrition rate is 33.3% (1 out of 3 team members left).
    Ethan Koshyâ€™s team has an average tenure of 2.17 years and an average performance rating of 3.00.
    Janya Ozaâ€™s team has an average tenure of 3.17 years and an average performance rating of 2.67.

2. BUSINESS CONTEXT:

    These findings highlight that both managers are experiencing high attrition rates in their small teams, which can disrupt team performance and continuity.
    The data provides a direct comparison of how team tenure and performance may relate to attrition, although the sample is too small for definitive conclusions.

3. KEY INSIGHTS:

    High attrition (33.3%) is consistent across both teams, regardless of differences in average tenure and performance.
    There is no clear evidence from this small sample that higher team tenure or higher performance is associated with lower attrition.
    The impact of attrition is magnified in small teams, making retention a critical focus for these managers.

4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:

    Conduct further investigation into the specific reasons for attrition within these teams (e.g., exit interviews, analysis of attrition type).
    Implement targeted retention initiatives for small teams with high attrition, such as enhanced career development, mentorship, or recognition programs.
    Support managers with resources and training to address potential management or team culture issues contributing to attrition.
    Regularly monitor attrition metrics at the team level to identify emerging issues early.

5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:

    What were the specific reasons (types of attrition) for the departures in these teams?
    How do these attrition rates compare to other managers and larger teams across the organization?
    Is there a broader trend between team tenure/performance and attrition when analyzing the full dataset?
    Are there other factors (e.g., compensation, workload, team engagement) influencing attrition in these teams?

Summary:
Both Ethan Koshy and Janya Oza are managing teams with high attrition rates (33.3%), but there is no clear link between team tenure or performance and attrition in this small sample. Immediate action is recommended to understand and address the causes of attrition in these teams, and further analysis is needed to identify broader patterns across the organization.

Among inactive employees eligible for rehire (Rehire Eligible = 1), which profiles are most worth nurturing as alumni (e.g., those with high performance ratings (>4 average across years), Expert Experience Category, and voluntary attrition), and how do they distribute across Sub Department 1 or Designation 1?
ðŸ§  Reasoning

Based on the analysis, there are currently zero inactive employees eligible for rehire who meet all your high-value alumni criteria (rehire eligible, average performance rating above 4, Expert Experience Category, and voluntary attrition). The data shows:

    total_high_value_alumni: 0
    sub_department_distribution: No sub-departments represented (empty)
    designation_distribution: No designations represented (empty)
    profiles: No individual profiles matched (empty DataFrame)

What does this mean for your business?

    At present, your alumni pool does not contain any former employees who are both high-performing experts and left on good terms (voluntarily) while being eligible for rehire. This could be due to overly strict criteria, data quality issues, or organizational patterns (e.g., high performers rarely leave voluntarily, or are not marked as rehire eligible).

Key Insights:

    No high-value alumni are available for targeted alumni engagement or rehire under the current definition.
    There is an opportunity to review and possibly adjust your alumni engagement strategy or internal processes to ensure you are not missing out on valuable talent.

Actionable Recommendations:

    Broaden Your Search Criteria: Consider including employees with slightly lower performance ratings or those in the 'Advanced' experience category to identify a larger pool of potential high-value alumni.
    Audit Rehire Eligibility Practices: Review how and why employees are marked as rehire eligible, especially among high performers and experts.
    Analyze Exit Data: Look into exit interviews and separation reasons for high performers to understand why they are not rehire eligible or not leaving voluntarily.
    Proactive Alumni Development: Develop strategies to ensure current high performers are more likely to become high-value alumni in the future (e.g., positive offboarding, maintaining relationships).

Follow-Up Analyses to Consider:

    What is the total number of high performers who are rehire eligible, regardless of experience or attrition type?
    Are there high performers who left involuntarily but might be reconsidered for alumni engagement?
    What are the most common reasons high performers are not rehire eligible?
    How many alumni meet two out of three criteria?
    How does the pool change if you adjust the performance or experience thresholds?

By taking these steps, you can better understand your alumni landscape and refine your talent engagement and rehire strategies for maximum business impact.

Is there a relationship between long promotion cycle gaps (e.g., >2 years between Promotion 1 and Promotion 2 based on Promotion years) and higher attrition rates, particularly for mid-level employees (Experience Category = Mid-level), and can this predict future hiring needs in high-attrition departments like AI/ML or HR?
ðŸ§  Reasoning

Based on the analysis, here is a comprehensive business interpretation:

1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS

    There is no available data on attrition rates by promotion gap for mid-level employees (mid_level_attrition_rate_by_promotion_gap is empty).
    The correlation between long promotion cycle gaps (>2 years) and attrition for mid-level employees is not calculable (nan).
    In the AI/ML and HR departments, there are zero mid-level employees with long promotion gaps (ai_ml_hr_long_gap_count: 0) and zero total mid-level employees in these departments (ai_ml_hr_total_count: 0). As a result, the attrition rate and the percentage of long promotion gaps are both nan.
    The predictive flag is False, indicating that long promotion cycle gaps cannot be used to predict future hiring needs in these departments.

2. BUSINESS CONTEXT

These findings mean that, for the current dataset, there is no evidence to suggest that long promotion cycles are linked to higher attrition among mid-level employees in AI/ML or HR. In fact, the scenario of mid-level employees with long promotion gaps does not exist in these departments according to the data. This could be due to a lack of such employees, a data collection issue, or a very small sample size.

3. KEY INSIGHTS

    There is no relationship between long promotion gaps and attrition among mid-level employees in AI/ML or HR, simply because there are no such employees in the data.
    The absence of data may point to a need for improved data tracking or could reflect the actual organizational structure.
    No predictive signal exists for using promotion cycle gaps to anticipate hiring needs in these departments.

4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

    Do not adjust hiring or retention strategies in AI/ML or HR based on promotion cycle gaps for mid-level employees, as there is no supporting data.
    Audit your HRIS and promotion tracking systems to ensure that all relevant employee movements and attrition events are being accurately recorded, especially in critical departments.
    Expand your analysis to include other departments, other employee experience categories, or different definitions of promotion gaps to see if the relationship exists elsewhere.
    Investigate other potential causes of attrition in AI/ML and HR, such as compensation, management, or work-life balance, since promotion timing is not a factor.

5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

    Is the lack of data due to a true absence of mid-level employees with long promotion gaps in AI/ML and HR, or is it a data quality issue?
    Are there other departments or employee categories where this analysis could be meaningful?
    What are the main drivers of attrition in AI/ML and HR if not promotion timing?
    Can the analysis be extended to include other career progression factors (e.g., lateral moves, training, or skill development)?
    How does the promotion cycle relate to attrition for other experience categories, such as entry-level or senior employees?

Summary:
There is currently no evidence to support a link between long promotion cycles and attrition among mid-level employees in AI/ML or HR, nor can this be used to predict future hiring needs in these departments. Focus should shift to ensuring robust data collection and exploring other potential drivers of attrition in these critical areas.
