Step 1: INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS
- The data contains three columns: tenure_years (employee tenure in years), latest_perf_rating (most recent performance rating, presumably on a 1â€“4 scale), and attrition_status (Active or Attrited).
- Sample data points:
    - Employee with 3.8 years tenure, performance rating 4.0, Active
    - Employee with 2.5 years tenure, performance rating 4.0, Attrited
    - Employee with 0.1 years tenure, performance rating 4.0, Attrited
    - Employee with 4.0 years tenure, performance rating 2.0, Attrited
    - Employee with 2.4 years tenure, performance rating 1.0, Active
    - Employee with 2.9 years tenure, performance rating 4.0, Attrited
- The plot likely visualizes tenure distribution, possibly as a histogram or boxplot, segmented by performance rating and/or attrition status.
Step 2: BUSINESS CONTEXT
- Understanding how tenure relates to performance and attrition is critical for talent management, retention strategies, and workforce planning.
- If high-performing, long-tenured employees are leaving, this signals a retention risk.
- If low-tenure, low-performing employees are leaving, this may be natural turnover.
Step 3: KEY INSIGHTS
- Attrited employees are present across all tenure ranges (from as low as 0.1 years to over 4 years).
- High performance ratings (4.0) are seen in both Active and Attrited employees, e.g., an Attrited employee with 2.5 years tenure and rating 4.0.
- Some Attrited employees have low tenure (e.g., 0.1 years), suggesting early exits.
- There are also Attrited employees with lower performance ratings (e.g., 2.0).
- Active employees are distributed across all performance ratings and tenure values, including low performance (e.g., 2.4 years, rating 1.0, Active).
Step 4: ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
- Investigate why high-performing employees with moderate tenure (e.g., 2.5 years, rating 4.0) are leaving.
- Examine onboarding and early engagement processes for new hires, given attrition at very low tenure (0.1 years).
- Assess whether low-performing employees are being retained longer than optimal (e.g., Active employees with low performance ratings and moderate tenure).
- Consider targeted retention programs for high performers at risk of leaving.
Step 5: FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
- What are the primary reasons for attrition among high-performing, mid-tenure employees?
- Is there a significant difference in tenure distribution between Active and Attrited employees overall?
- How does attrition rate vary by performance rating and tenure cohort?
- Are there department or role-based patterns in these tenure/performance/attrition relationships?
Based on the analysis of the plot and underlying data, here are the comprehensive business insights and recommendations:
**1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS**
- The data shows that employees who have left ("Attrited") are distributed across the entire tenure spectrum, from as little as 0.1 years to over 4 years.
- High performance ratings (4.0) are present among both Active and Attrited employees. For example, an employee with 2.5 years tenure and a 4.0 rating has left, as has one with 0.1 years tenure and a 4.0 rating.
- Attrition is not limited to low performers; some high performers are also leaving.
- There are Active employees with low performance ratings (e.g., 2.4 years tenure, 1.0 rating), indicating that low performers are sometimes retained.
- Attrition occurs both very early (0.1 years) and after several years (e.g., 4.0 years), suggesting multiple drivers.
**2. BUSINESS CONTEXT**
- These findings are crucial for HR and business leaders: losing high-performing, mid-tenure employees can be costly and disruptive.
- Early attrition (within the first year) may indicate onboarding, role fit, or expectation issues.
- Retaining low-performing employees may hinder team productivity and morale.
**3. KEY INSIGHTS**
- Attrition is not isolated to any single tenure or performance group; it is spread across the spectrum.
- High-performing employees are at risk of leaving, not just low performers.
- Early exits (low tenure) are present, which could indicate onboarding or cultural fit challenges.
- Some low-performing employees remain with the company for extended periods.
**4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **Conduct Exit Interviews:** Focus on high-performing, mid-tenure employees to understand their reasons for leaving.
- **Strengthen Onboarding:** Review and enhance onboarding and early engagement processes to reduce very early attrition.
- **Performance Management:** Evaluate why low-performing employees are being retained and whether performance management processes need reinforcement.
- **Targeted Retention Programs:** Develop retention strategies specifically for high performers at risk of leaving, such as career development opportunities, recognition, or tailored incentives.
- **Regular Tenure-Performance Reviews:** Monitor tenure and performance data regularly to identify at-risk groups before attrition occurs.
**5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS**
- What are the most common reasons for attrition among high-performing, mid-tenure employees?
- How does the overall attrition rate compare between different performance rating groups?
- Are there specific departments or roles where high-performing employees are more likely to leave?
- What is the impact of manager quality or engagement scores on these attrition patterns?
- How do compensation and career progression opportunities correlate with attrition among different tenure and performance cohorts?
**Summary:**  
The analysis reveals that attrition affects both high and low performers across all tenure ranges, with notable early exits and some retention of low performers. The business should prioritize understanding and addressing the drivers of high-performer attrition, strengthen onboarding, and review performance management practices to optimize retention and workforce quality. Further segmentation by department, role, and attrition reason will provide deeper, actionable insights.
