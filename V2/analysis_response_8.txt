1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS:
- The data presents attrition metrics for two reporting managers: Ethan Koshy (Manager_ID: PU20231320) and Janya Oza (Manager_ID: PU20231332).
- Both managers have small teams (Team_Size = 3).
- For both teams, 1 out of 3 employees is marked as attrited (Is_Attrited = 1), resulting in an Attrition_Rate of 0.333333 (33.3%).
- Average team tenure (Team_Tenure) is 2.17 years for Ethan Koshy and 3.17 years for Janya Oza.
- Average latest performance rating (Latest_Perf) is 3.00 for Ethan Koshyâ€™s team and 2.67 for Janya Ozaâ€™s team.
2. BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- The analysis directly addresses the userâ€™s query by breaking down attrition rates by reporting manager and relating them to team-level factors (tenure and performance).
- High attrition rates (33.3%) in both teams are notable, especially given the small team sizes, which can magnify the impact of each departure.
- Team tenure and performance ratings are provided to help assess whether more experienced or higher-performing teams are more or less likely to experience attrition.
3. KEY INSIGHTS:
- Both managers have identical attrition rates (33.3%), but their teams differ in average tenure and performance.
- Ethan Koshyâ€™s team has a lower average tenure (2.17 years) and slightly higher performance (3.00) compared to Janya Ozaâ€™s team (3.17 years tenure, 2.67 performance).
- There is no clear pattern between higher tenure or higher performance and lower attrition in this small sample: the team with higher tenure and lower performance (Janya Oza) has the same attrition rate as the team with lower tenure and higher performance (Ethan Koshy).
- The sample size is very small (n=2 managers, 3 employees each), so findings are preliminary and may not generalize.
4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Investigate the specific reasons for attrition in these teams (voluntary vs. involuntary, and the detailed categories).
- Given the high attrition rate, conduct exit interviews or surveys to identify root causes for departures.
- Review team management practices, especially for small teams where each departure has a significant impact.
- Consider targeted retention strategies for teams with high attrition, such as career development opportunities or workload adjustments.
- Monitor these teams closely for further attrition and intervene early.
5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- What are the detailed types of attrition (e.g., career growth, compensation, performance issues) for the employees who left these teams?
- How do these managersâ€™ attrition rates compare to other managers with larger teams?
- Is there a statistically significant correlation between team tenure/performance and attrition across a larger dataset?
- Are there organizational or departmental patterns in attrition that could inform broader HR strategies?
Based on the analysis of the provided results:
**1. INTERPRET THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS:**
- For both Ethan Koshy (Manager_ID: PU20231320) and Janya Oza (Manager_ID: PU20231332), the attrition rate is 33.3% (1 out of 3 team members left).
- Ethan Koshyâ€™s team has an average tenure of 2.17 years and an average performance rating of 3.00.
- Janya Ozaâ€™s team has an average tenure of 3.17 years and an average performance rating of 2.67.
**2. BUSINESS CONTEXT:**
- These findings highlight that both managers are experiencing high attrition rates in their small teams, which can disrupt team performance and continuity.
- The data provides a direct comparison of how team tenure and performance may relate to attrition, although the sample is too small for definitive conclusions.
**3. KEY INSIGHTS:**
- High attrition (33.3%) is consistent across both teams, regardless of differences in average tenure and performance.
- There is no clear evidence from this small sample that higher team tenure or higher performance is associated with lower attrition.
- The impact of attrition is magnified in small teams, making retention a critical focus for these managers.
**4. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Conduct further investigation into the specific reasons for attrition within these teams (e.g., exit interviews, analysis of attrition type).
- Implement targeted retention initiatives for small teams with high attrition, such as enhanced career development, mentorship, or recognition programs.
- Support managers with resources and training to address potential management or team culture issues contributing to attrition.
- Regularly monitor attrition metrics at the team level to identify emerging issues early.
**5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:**
- What were the specific reasons (types of attrition) for the departures in these teams?
- How do these attrition rates compare to other managers and larger teams across the organization?
- Is there a broader trend between team tenure/performance and attrition when analyzing the full dataset?
- Are there other factors (e.g., compensation, workload, team engagement) influencing attrition in these teams?
**Summary:**  
Both Ethan Koshy and Janya Oza are managing teams with high attrition rates (33.3%), but there is no clear link between team tenure or performance and attrition in this small sample. Immediate action is recommended to understand and address the causes of attrition in these teams, and further analysis is needed to identify broader patterns across the organization.
